%Author : Andrew Dempster
%Purpose : To estimate the minimum primitive operator cost of a set of 
%	coefficients.
%Inputs : inputcoefft - the input coefficient vector
%Uses : vectadd.m - creates a matrix sum of pairs of elements in 2 vectors
%	extend.m - creates the array of powers of 2 for one fundamental
%	first0.m - evaluates the position of the first 0 in an array
%	step6.m, step7.m, step9.m - steps in the algorithm made subroutines
%Outputs : adders - the adder cost of the coefficient set
%	optimal - a flag indicating if adders is the optimal cost 
%		of inputcoefft. 0 does not necessarily indicate non-optimal
%	fundarray - the array of fundamentals in the graph, in the
%		order they were added

% Algorithm Description
%
% (If at any time the input array becomes empty, the algorithm terminates)
%
% 1. Reduce all coefficients in the input set to fundamentals.
%
% 2. Evaluate the single-coefficient costs of each coefficient using the cost
%lookup table.
%
% 3. Remove from the input set all zero-cost and repeated fundamentals.
%
% 4. Create an array of required fundamentals. Into this array enter all the
%cost-1 fundamentals in the input set. Remove the cost-1s from the input set.
%
% 5. This step is analagous to the "second search" of the two coefficient
%algorithm. The idea is to exhaustively check if a pair of fundamentals in the
%required fundamental set can be used to generate a coefficient in the input 
%set at the cost of a single adder. In a similar way to Bull and Horrocks, an
%array of possible sums is produced. If any of the input set are represented, 
%then that element is removed and placed in the required fundamental set.
%
% 6. Because step 5, by adding vertices to the required fundamental 
%array, increases the possibilities available for generating cost 1 vertices, 
%repeat it until no further vertices are added to the required fundamental 
%array. 
%
% (From here the algorithm becomes suboptimal)
% 7. Looking now at the concept of minimum adder distance, i.e. the number of
%adders to get from the existing graph to each coefficient. Prior to this step,
%coefficients are added if their distance is one. In this step, coefficients at
%distance two are added. Distance 2 is when the difference between the
%coefficient and an existing extended fundamental has cost 1, or when the
%difference between the sums of existing extended fundamentals and the coefft
%is cost 0. In the case of a cost 1 distance, if there are several cost 1
%paths, the fundamental of least numerical value is selected.
%
%8. Repeat step 7 until no further distance 2 fundamentals are added.
%
%9. The remaining unsynthesised coefficients will be listed with their distance
%from the graph, and the minimum fundamental of highest cost in the path. Add
%this fundamental and its path of least fundamentals to the required list.
%
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%Suboptimality of the algorithm is due to the following:
%1. Incompleteness of the lookup table for requisite fundamentals, pofundlut.
%For cost-3 and less integers up to 2048, POFUND.MAT provides an exhaustive 
%list of requisite fundamental sets. Cost-4 lists are truncated to length 200.
%For the range 2049 - 4096, all lists (i.e.
%costs 0 to 4, although only costs 3 and 4 have long lists) are truncated to 
%length 100, so they are not exhaustive. For cost-4, only the first 6 of the 
%possible 29 graphs are implemented, which does not have a great effect since 
%the list is truncated anyway.
%2. The order in which distance 2 or more coeffts are added, and the
%fundamental path to that coefft are arbitrary, although statistically the
%results should  be good.
